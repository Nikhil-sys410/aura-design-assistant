📖 About The Project

AURA is an avant-garde design assistant built for fashion merchandisers, creative directors, and digital artists. In the fast-paced world of fashion, translating abstract trend signals into concrete visual concepts is a bottleneck.

AURA acts as a creative co-pilot, synthesizing category inputs (like Streetwear or Haute Couture) with mood keywords to generate Midjourney-ready prompts and Market Trend Analysis.

✨ Key Features

🎨 Generative Prompt Engineering: Automatically crafts complex, high-fidelity prompts optimized for Midjourney v6, Stable Diffusion, and Dall-E 3.

📈 Trend Intelligence: Simulates market confidence scores and trend forecasting data.

💎 Hyper-Modern UI: * Neo-Glassmorphism: Frosted glass cards and deep gradients.

High-Contrast Mode: Optimized typography for readability in dark environments.

Responsive Bento Grid: A fluid layout that adapts to screen sizes.
